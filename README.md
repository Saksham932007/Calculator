# 🧠✏️ AI Visual Calculator

An intelligent, interactive calculator inspired by the iPad's visual interface — powered by AI and computer vision. Instead of typing equations, users can **draw** mathematical expressions or **ask questions by sketching diagrams**, and the AI will **understand**, **solve**, and **explain** the answer visually.

## 🚀 Features

- ✍️ **Draw to Solve**: Simply draw numbers, operations, or graphs — the AI understands it all.
- 🧮 **Equation Recognition**: Automatically converts hand-drawn equations into solvable LaTeX/MathML.
- 📈 **Visual Feedback**: Displays results with clean, visual formatting — including steps and graphs.
- 🗣️ **Ask with Images**: Upload a sketched diagram or image to ask questions like “What’s the area?” or “What’s the slope?”
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Engine**: Combines OCR, CNN models, and NLP to process images and deliver intelligent results.
- 🌐 **Web-based UI** (optional): Works in browser with intuitive drawing canvas.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5 Canvas / React (optional)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask / FastAPI)
- **AI/ML**:
  - Handwriting recognition (CNN with TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch)
  - OCR (Tesseract or custom model)
  - Symbol classification
  - Math parsing and solving using `SymPy` or `WolframAlpha API`
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib / LaTeX rendering

## 📦 Installation
